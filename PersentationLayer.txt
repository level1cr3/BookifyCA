# Persentation layer
					: Acts as a entry point into our system and It is usually a RESTful API, grpc service or single page application. The main responsibility of 
					persentation layer is to take request that are coming to our system package them up into commands or queries and send them using the Mediatr 
					pattern to the application layer.

					It acts as the composition root for our services. And this is where we are going to implement dependecy injection for all of our layers.

> Web API, .NET 8

> Controllers  : they will hold our endpoints.

> Middleware   : to solve crosscutting concerns

> DI Setup

> Docker compose.



# we will add project reference to application and infrastructure layer. So we can add the corrosponding dependency injection calls
and configure services that are defined in these projects
