what is Entity ?
it is a object that has a unique identifier id. and it contineous that means existence of this object is important throught
the life of the application


what is premitive obsession ?
Primitive obsession is a term used in software development to describe the overuse of primitive data types (such as integers, strings, floats, etc.) 
to represent concepts or entities within the domain of an application. This anti-pattern can lead to code that is less readable, more error-prone, 
and harder to maintain. It typically indicates a failure to use more appropriate abstractions or custom types.

Problems with Primitive Obsession:
* Lack of Clarity: Using primitive types often leads to ambiguous and less expressive code.
* Validation: Validation logic is often duplicated throughout the codebase instead of being encapsulated in a single place.
* Business Logic: Business rules and constraints are scattered across the codebase rather than being encapsulated in domain-specific types.
* Error-Prone: Increased risk of errors, such as passing parameters in the wrong order or using the wrong type of data.

Solutions to Primitive Obsession:
* Value Objects: Create custom types to represent domain concepts more accurately.
* Encapsulation: Encapsulate related data and behavior within objects.
* Type Safety: Use types to enforce constraints and business rules.

Benefits of Avoiding Primitive Obsession:
* Improved Readability: Code becomes more expressive and easier to understand.
* Centralized Validation: Validation logic is encapsulated within value objects, reducing duplication.
* Enhanced Maintainability: Code is easier to maintain and refactor.
* Reduced Errors: Increased type safety reduces the likelihood of passing incorrect values.


for apartment model changes.

We initially began with an anemic domain model that used only primitive types. Now, we have developed a rich and expressive domain model, 
where properties convey meaningful context and encapsulate accompanying behavior.


what is anemic domain model ?

An anemic domain model is a software design anti-pattern commonly observed in domain-driven design (DDD). 
It refers to a domain model where business logic is absent from the domain objects, leaving them as mere data containers with little to no 
behavior or logic encapsulated within them. Instead, the business logic is typically implemented in separate service classes.

### Benefit of Wrapping the Constructor Inside a Factory Method

#### Why Use a Factory Method?

1. **Hiding Constructor Details**:
   - **Explanation**: Sometimes, a constructor might have complex details or logic that you don't want other parts of your code to see or use directly.
   - **Simple Term**: It's like having a secret recipe for making a dish and not letting everyone know the exact steps, but just giving them the dish.

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - **Explanation**: Encapsulation is about keeping certain parts of your code hidden and protected, so they can't be misused.
   - **Simple Term**: It's like putting a fence around your garden to keep it safe and controlled.

3. **Introducing Side-Effects**:
   - **Explanation**: Sometimes, you need to do extra things (side-effects) when creating an object, which don't belong in the constructor. 
                      A factory method is a good place for these extra tasks.

   - **Simple Term**: It's like adding special decorations to a cake after it's baked. The baking process (constructor) doesn't include the decorations, 
                      but the final cake (object) does.

#### Example: Domain Events

- **Domain Events**: These are things that happen in your application that other parts of the application might need to know about. 
                     For example, if a user registers, you might want to send a welcome email.

By using a factory method, you can handle such events easily without cluttering the constructor.

### Code Example

```csharp
public class User
{
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public string Email { get; private set; }

    // Private constructor to hide it from outside
    private User(string name, string email)
    {
        Name = name;
        Email = email;
    }

    // Factory method
    public static User CreateUser(string name, string email)
    {
        // Side-effect: Log user creation
        Console.WriteLine("Creating user and logging this action.");

        // Create the user
        return new User(name, email);
    }
}
```

### In Simple Terms

1. **Hide Details**: The constructor is private, so no one outside can use it directly.
2. **Encapsulation**: By using the factory method, you keep the creation process controlled and safe.
3. **Side-Effects**: You can do extra things (like logging) in the factory method, which you don't want in the constructor.

This makes your code cleaner, safer, and more flexible.

To persist the entity inside of database for that we will be using the repository pattern.
Unitofwork and repository pattern are nessary of defining the rich domain model.
In DDD we look repository as entityrepository meaning that my repository can only operate on my domain entities. This even be further imposed by using
generic constrain which require which require the repository type to implement the entity base class.

# Application Layer.
>   It sits one level above the domain layer. It is allowed to reference the domain layer. It is still part of the  application core.
    it doesn't have any external concerns of its own. However there are some trade of we can make in application layer particularly when it comes to querying the database.


> the main concern of application laayer is implementing the use cases. use cases are the responsible for using rich domain model from domain layer.
and orchastrating it to perform the business logic.

    we will use CQRS pattern with mediatr to implement our use cases


> we will solve cross cutting concerns in our application
    * Loggin
    * Validation


> Exception

> DI configuration.




# CQRS : stands for command query responsibility segregation.
        It splits the responsibility of writing the data from reading the data into seprate classes or objects


Pros:
    * Single responsibility principle : every command or query is responsible for only one thing
    * interface segregation principle : this states that we should only depend on methods that we actually use.
    in case of command and query handle we are only going to have one method handle.

    * decorater pattern : we can use decorator pattern to handle the cross cutting concerns. with mediatr library we have access to pipeline behavior which 
    are essentially a form of decorator pattern

    * loose coupling. the command and command handler , query and query handler don't have to know about each other. mediatr is responsible for connecting them in 
    runtime. consumer only needs to know about the command or query and how to publish it using the mediatr. everything else is taken care of somewhere else



cons:
    indirection : It is harder to reason about which class handles the request.
